# HOW IT'S WORK ??
## requirement
  - you need to install Homebrew [install it](https://github.com/kube/42homebrew)
  - then use this command
  ```Shell
    brew install coreutils
  ```
## how to execute ??
  1. just download the repo and execute your code with output like thise push_swap
  2. copy the output file (push_swap) and past it here in (tester_push_swap)
  3. you can replace the checker (use of the school or yours to test it)
  4. now execute script.sh `[test_number]` `[number_of_repetiton]` `[limit_number_of_instruction]` see below
  ```Shell
  bash script.sh 100 10 699
  ```
  > in example above if your push_swap greater then 699 the script will display the stack that is above 699 and exit
